# UVL - Universal Variability Language

This is a small default library used to parse and print the Universal Variability Language (UVL).
It is written in Clojure, but can also be used from any JVM language, as it exposes a Java API.

Under the hood it uses [instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) as the parsing library.
The grammar in EBNF form is located in `resources/uvl.bnf`

## Building a jar

To create a Java-consumable jar, the [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) build tool is used.
`lein` will compile first the Clojure source, and then the Java source.
Both compiled Java and Clojure source will be packaged into a jar.

This is achieved through the uberjar task:

```
$ lein uberjar
Compiling de.neominik.uvl.ast
Compiling de.neominik.uvl.parser
Compiling de.neominik.uvl.transform
Compiling 1 source files to uvl-clj/target/classes
Created uvl-clj/target/uvl-parser-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Created uvl-clj/target/uvl-parser-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

The `standalone.jar` includes all dependencies, while the other jar ships only the code of the uvl-parser itself, without Clojure or instaparse.

## Usage from Java
The class `de.neominik.uvl.UVLParser` exposes the static method `parse(String)` which will return an instance of a `de.neominik.uvl.UVLModel` on success or a `de.neominik.uvl.ParseError` when the input didn't comply to the grammar.

Printing is implemented in the `toString()`methods of the different model elements in the `UVLModel`.
